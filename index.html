      <h1>Debugging</h1>
      <h2>Expectations vs Reality</h2>
      <p>
        One of the most common misconceptions about debugging is that it is
        about your code not working. This could not be further from the truth.
        Your code, in a sense, almost always <em>works</em>. In other words,
        <em>it does exactly what you tell it to do.</em> The real problem, then,
        is that <em class="bold">you gave it the wrong instructions.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What this means is that somewhere along the line, the output you
        <em>expected</em> your code to produce diverged from what it
        <em>actually</em> produced in reality. <em>This</em> is the problem at
        the heart of debugging:
        <em class="bold">a mismatch between expectations and reality.</em>
      </p>
      <h2>The Point of First Divergence</h2>
      <p>
        Say you have a program that operates on some data. You have ten
        different procedures, all of which modify some data before taking that
        data to the next procedure. We'll number them P1 through P10. They're
        represented below:
      </p>
      <div class="procedures-box">
        <div class="procedure">P1</div>
        <div class="procedure">P2</div>
        <div class="procedure">P3</div>
        <div class="procedure">P4</div>
        <div class="procedure">P5</div>
        <div class="procedure">P6</div>
        <div class="procedure">P7</div>
        <div class="procedure">P8</div>
        <div class="procedure">P9</div>
        <div class="procedure">P10</div>
      </div>
      <p>Say we pass some data into P1, data which we know is expected</p>
      <div class="procedures-box">
        <div class="data good-data">Expected Data</div>
        <div class="symbol">&rArr;</div>
        <div class="procedure">P1</div>
        <div class="procedure">P2</div>
        <div class="procedure">P3</div>
        <div class="procedure">P4</div>
        <div class="procedure">P5</div>
        <div class="procedure">P6</div>
        <div class="procedure">P7</div>
        <div class="procedure">P8</div>
        <div class="procedure">P9</div>
        <div class="procedure">P10</div>
      </div>
      <p>
        We run the program, and we get some data out of it... but that output
        data is not what we want! It's
        <em>a mismatch between expectations and reality</em>.
      </p>
      <div class="procedures-box">
        <div class="data good-data">Expected Data</div>
        <div class="symbol">&rArr;</div>
        <div class="procedure">P1</div>
        <div class="procedure">P2</div>
        <div class="procedure">P3</div>
        <div class="procedure">P4</div>
        <div class="procedure">P5</div>
        <div class="procedure">P6</div>
        <div class="procedure">P7</div>
        <div class="procedure">P8</div>
        <div class="procedure">P9</div>
        <div class="procedure">P10</div>
        <div class="symbol">&rArr;</div>
        <div class="data bad-data">Unexpected Data</div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Somewhere along the line, somewhere amongst these ten procedures, there
        was a mismatch in expectations in our code. This mismatch in
        expectations led to the offending procedure modifying our data in the
        wrong way. In other words, there was some procedure that
        <em>took in expected data</em> and <em>put out unexpected data</em>.
      </p>
      <div class="horizontal">
        <div>
          <h3>Good</h3>
          <p>
            A good procedure will take in Expected Data and put out Expected
            Data.
          </p>
          <div class="procedures-box">
            <div class="data good-data">Expected Data</div>
            <div class="symbol">&rArr;</div>
            <div class="procedure">P</div>
            <div class="symbol">&rArr;</div>
            <div class="data good-data">Expected Data</div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Bad</h3>
          <p>
            A bad procedure will take in Expected Data and put out Unexpected
            Data.
          </p>
          <div class="procedures-box">
            <div class="data good-data">Expected Data</div>
            <div class="symbol">&rArr;</div>
            <div class="procedure">P</div>
            <div class="symbol">&rArr;</div>
            <div class="data bad-data">Unexpected Data</div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        This only accounts for two of the possible four cases. We actually can't
        say much about a procedure that <em>takes in unexpected data</em>. After
        all, <em>garbage in, garbage out.</em> We should never rely on our
        ability to deduce correct conclusions from incorrect data.
      </p>
      <div class="horizontal">
        <div>
          <h3>Unsure if Broken</h3>
          <div class="procedures-box">
            <div class="data bad-data">Unexpected Data</div>
            <div class="symbol">&rArr;</div>
            <div class="procedure">P</div>
            <div class="symbol">&rArr;</div>
            <div class="data good-or-bad-data">Either Data</div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        What this means is that as soon as our data becomes unexpected, we can
        no longer debug a procedure further down the "chain." For instance, if
        P5 is broken, then we can't be sure whether P6 works, because P6 will be
        taking in unexpected data from P5. And if we can't be sure that P6
        works, we can't be sure if P7 works. And if we can't be sure that P7
        works, we can't be sure if P8 works. And so on and so forth.
      </p>
      <p>
        What <em>this</em> means is that we should aim to find and debug the
        <em>first</em> procedure along the chain to exhibit unexpected behavior,
        because this is the <em>only</em> one we can truly <em>verify</em> to be
        broken. This first broken procedure is what I like to call
        <em class="bold">The Point of First Divergence</em>.
      </p>
      <h3>Finding The Point of First Divergence</h3>
      <p>
        This begs the question: How do we <em>find</em> this procedure? Checking
        all ten procedures for bugs would be rather slow. Is there a faster way?
      </p>
      <p>
        We can start by asking a question: Is the point of first divergence
        between P1 and P5, or is it between P6 and P10? It turns out that to
        solve this question, we only need to make a single, very simple change:
      </p>
      <div class="procedures-box">
        <div class="data good-data">Expected Data</div>
        <div class="symbol">&rArr;</div>
        <div class="procedure">P1</div>
        <div class="procedure">P2</div>
        <div class="procedure">P3</div>
        <div class="procedure">P4</div>
        <div class="procedure">P5</div>
        <div class="procedure highlighted-procedure">Logger</div>
        <div class="procedure">P6</div>
        <div class="procedure">P7</div>
        <div class="procedure">P8</div>
        <div class="procedure">P9</div>
        <div class="procedure">P10</div>
        <div class="symbol">&rArr;</div>
        <div class="data bad-data">Unexpected Data</div>
      </div>
      <p>
        What we've added is a "logger" procedure between P5 and P6. All this
        procedure will do is tell us what the data will look like
        <em>after being modified by P5</em> but
        <em>before being modified by P6</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Say that the logger outputs unexpected data. This means that, by the
        time it exited P5, something went wrong. P5 could be producing
        unexpected data. However, P4 could also have been producing unexpected
        data that <em>stayed bad</em> as it passed through P5. Likewise for P3,
        P2, and P1.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, if the logger outputs expected data, since we
        <em>know</em> that it will be unexpected by the <em>end</em> of the
        program, it must have become unexpected somewhere <em>later on</em> into
        the program&mdash; i.e. somewhere between P6 and P10. While this does
        not eliminate the possibility of an <em>earlier</em> error, it
        guarantees the possibilty of a <em>later</em> error.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summary, if the logger outputs unexpected data, an error occurred
        between P1 and P5. If the logger outputs expected data, an error
        occurred between P6 and P10.
      </p>
      <p>
        Speaking more generally, if the logger outputs unexpected data, the
        error happened <em>before</em> the logger. If the logger outputs
        expected data, the error happened <em>after</em> the logger. With a
        single addition to our program, we've cut our search space in
        <em>half</em>.
      </p>
      <h3>Repeating this process again</h3>
      <p>
        For the sake of example, let's say the logger outputted unexpected data.
        Therefore, P1 through P5 could be the source of the error:
      </p>
      <div class="procedures-box">
        <div class="data good-data">Expected Data</div>
        <div class="symbol">&rArr;</div>
        <div class="procedure highlighted-procedure">P1</div>
        <div class="procedure highlighted-procedure">P2</div>
        <div class="procedure highlighted-procedure">P3</div>
        <div class="procedure highlighted-procedure">P4</div>
        <div class="procedure highlighted-procedure">P5</div>
        <div class="procedure">P6</div>
        <div class="procedure">P7</div>
        <div class="procedure">P8</div>
        <div class="procedure">P9</div>
        <div class="procedure">P10</div>
        <div class="symbol">&rArr;</div>
        <div class="data bad-data">Unexpected Data</div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Now that we know this, we can apply the same process again and add a
        logger between, say, P3 and P4.
      </p>
      <div class="procedures-box">
        <div class="data good-data">Expected Data</div>
        <div class="symbol">&rArr;</div>
        <div class="procedure">P1</div>
        <div class="procedure">P2</div>
        <div class="procedure">P3</div>
        <div class="procedure highlighted-procedure">Logger</div>
        <div class="procedure">P4</div>
        <div class="procedure">P5</div>
        <div class="procedure">P6</div>
        <div class="procedure">P7</div>
        <div class="procedure">P8</div>
        <div class="procedure">P9</div>
        <div class="procedure">P10</div>
        <div class="symbol">&rArr;</div>
        <div class="data bad-data">Unexpected Data</div>
      </div>
      <p>
        The same logic from the last section still applies. If the logger
        outputs unexpected data, then P1, P2, or P3 could be broken. If the
        logger outputs expected data, then P4 or P5 could be broken.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can keep on repeating this process, subdividing the chain of
        procedures in two until we finally show that
        <em>one specific procedure</em> is responsible for the bug. This is a
        process known as <em>binary search</em>. Using it, rather than having to
        test all ten procedures separately, we only need to test
        <em>at most four</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this seems like a fairly mediocre improvement, the benefits of
        binary search become more apparent when we increase the number of
        procedures. With 100 procedures, we only need at most 7 steps of binary
        search. With 1000, we only need at most 10.
